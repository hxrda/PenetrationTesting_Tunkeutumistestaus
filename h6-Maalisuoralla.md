## I'll Let Myself In: Tactics & War Stories of Physical Pen Testing (Wild West Hackin' Fest)

**<ins>Overview/ Definition of Physical Penetration Testing</ins>**

-	Physical penetration testing involves testing physical security defenses to expose vulnerabilities in facility access control systems and security.
-	It’s not limited to lockpicking only. A wide variety of mechanical, electronic or social engineering techniques can be used to gain unauthorized access.

**<ins>Tactics & Techniques used in Physical Penetration Testing</ins>**

**Lock manipulation:**
- Tools such as lockpicks and shims are used to bypass functional locks.
- Latch slipping tools exploit poorly maintained or misaligned locks.
  
**Mechanical door bypass techniques:**
- Common attack surfaces include door edge gaps, hinges or improperly installed hardware.
- Tools include e.g., under-door tools, hinge pin removal tools, door latch bypass tools.

**Request-to-Exit (REX) sensors:**
- Exploitation of exposed REX sensors to unlock doors from the outside.
- Techniques include air dusters, hand movements or directing heat toward the sensor.

**Electronic credentials & locks:**
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities in access control readers and electronic locks.
- Use of credential sniffing and cloning to steal and reuse access data (e.g., hardware sniffer installation behind readers to intercept badge data).

**Keyed-alike systems:**
- Exploitation of keyed-alike systems that use the same physical key across multiple locks.
- A stolen/duplicated key can be used to grant access to multiple areas within a facility. 

**Social engineering:**
- Impersonation / role-playing as authorized personnel 
- Tailgating
- Use of fake badges, uniforms, distractions to divert attention and reduce suspicion

**Other Takeaways**
- Confidence is key. An appearance of authority or belonging can be as effective as technical bypass methods.
- Human factors are a common weak link. Reluctance to confront others or question behavior is often exploited for successful physical intrusions.
